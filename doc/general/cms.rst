CMS

This section describes how the CMS can and should be used.

Header images
=============
A default header image is hardcoded, but this can be overruled
with the CMS. To be able to overrule this, the page you wish
to edit has to exist as a CMS page.

Log in to the website. The CMS toolbar should now appear, if it
doesn't, in the top right of the screen click the arrow. Next
to the djangoCMS logo, your domain is visible. Click it, and
choose 'Beheer...'.

A side panel has opened on the left. Navigate to CMS -> Pagina's.
Scroll the sidebar to the right, and click 'pagina toevoegen'.

Fill in the details and save the page. Edit it with the advanced
settings so you can enter the URL for the page.
